Thank you for your ongoing help!  Please see responses to previous comments as bullets below:

Please proof-read your description text.
Currently it reads:    "...  to allow users to easily read all documentation and source code. ..."
Probably it should be: "...  to allow users to easily read all the documentation and source code. ..."
and
Currently it reads:    "...  tructural equation models as a nested submodels, ..."
Probably it should be: "...  tructural equation models as a nested submodel, ..."

* We have carefully proof-read this text.  We instead say "... all of the documentation" and ".. as nested submodels", but agree that this wording needed improvement.

We still see an example wrapped within \dontrun{} in phylosem.Rd, which I think is not necessary.
Please unwrap the examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, or replace \dontrun{} with \donttest{} or explain why dontrun{} is indeed necessary there.

* Thank you for continuing to suggest that we include these.  We have now eliminated all use of \dontrun{}.
