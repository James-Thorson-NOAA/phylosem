\title{Reinstalling binary dependencies}
\description{
The \code{phylosem} package depends on several upstream packages, which it
uses in a way that depends heavily on their internal (binary) structure.
Sometimes, therefore, installing an update to one of these packages will
require that you re-install a \emph{binary-compatible} version of \code{phylosem},
i.e. a version that has been compiled with the updated version of the upstream
package.
\itemize{
\item If you have development tools (compilers etc.) installed, you
should be able to re-install a binary-compatible version of the package by running
\code{install.packages("phylosem", type="source")}. If you want to install
the development version of \code{phylosem} instead, you can use
\code{remotes::install_github("James-Thorson-NOAA/phylosem")}.
(On Windows, you can install development tools following the instructions at
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}; on MacOS, see
\url{https://mac.r-project.org/tools/}.)

\item If you do \emph{not} have development tools and can't/don't want to
install them (and so can't install packages with compiled code from source),
you can revert the upstream package(s) to their previous binary version. For example, using the
\code{checkpoint} package:
\preformatted{
## load (installing if necessary) the checkpoint package
while (!require("checkpoint")) install.packages("checkpoint")
## retrieve build date of installed version of phylosem
bd <- as.character(asDateBuilt(
      packageDescription("phylosem",fields="Built")))
oldrepo <- getOption("repos")
use_mran_snapshot(bd) ## was setSnapshot() pre-checkpoint v1.0.0
install.packages("TMB")
options(repos=oldrepo) ## restore original repo
}
A similar recipe (substituting \code{Matrix} for \code{TMB} and \code{TMB} for \code{phylosem})
can be used if you get warnings about an incompatibility between \code{TMB} and \code{Matrix}.
